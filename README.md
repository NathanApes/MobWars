# MobWars
OK, here's the jist:

MobWars is a minigame plugin that allows the player to control mobs and use them to defeat the other player's mobs!
When you command your army of mobs in the right fashion, you will ultimately win the match!
Simple as that...

MobWars was inspired by many other strategy game that I, NathanApes, have played. So, I thought-Why not make your own! XD
So, there you have a basic description of my MobWars minigame.
