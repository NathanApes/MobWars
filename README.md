# MobWars
MobWars is a strategy inspired game I've needed to make for almost 5 years now. If you're reading this because the game is awesome and you wanted to see its source, then you have my uttermost thanks. 

Anyway, this game is about War. It evolved from the idea of primative mobs being commanded into battle by players to destroy each other, to the idea of players fighting for a commander who leads them into battle.

This is what MobWars is: Literally. The war between mobs.

Thank you for visiting the page and if you're here to inspect my work, then go ahead.

This is MobWars.
